# INDE-577-Maching-Learning
This repository intends to show the final project of course INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning, instructed by Randy R. Davila. Throughout the semester, we have learned algorithms from supervised and unsupervised learning, and in this repository, I will implement these techniques to finish the project.
## Supervised Learning
* Linear Regression
* KNN
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Gradient Descent
* Linear Regression
* Perceptron
