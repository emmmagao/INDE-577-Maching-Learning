# INDE-577-Maching-Learning
This repository intends to show the final project of course INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning, instructed by Randy R. Davila. Throughout the semester, we have learned algorithms from supervised and unsupervised learning, and in this repository, I will implement these techniques to finish the project.
#### Supervised Learning
* Decision Tree
* Gradient Descent
* KNN
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Neural Network
* Perceptron
* Random Forest
* SVM
#### Unsupervised Learning
* K-means clustering
## Data
Datasets used in this repository are mainly coming from Kaggles and UCI Machine Learning Repository.
## Programming Tool
In this repository, I mainly used Python, Jupyter Notebook.
