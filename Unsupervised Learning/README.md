## Unsupervised Learning

## Definition
Unsupervised learning analyzes and clusters unlabeled data sets by machine learning algorithms. These algorithms find hidden patterns in data without the assistance of humans (thus the term "unsupervised"). The goal for unsupervised learning is to get some insights from a large dataset. One of the main objects for unsupervised learning is clustering. Clustering can group unlabeled data into groups based on similarities and differences.

###### K-Means Clustering

divide related data points into groups, with the K value indicating the size and granularity of the grouping. This method is useful for market segmentation, image compression, and other applications.
