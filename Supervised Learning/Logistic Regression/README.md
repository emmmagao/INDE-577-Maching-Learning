# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical approach for developing machine learning models using dichotomous dependent variables, i.e. binary. Logistic regression is a statistical technique used to describe data and the connection between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Independent variables may be nominal, ordinal, or interval in nature. The term "logistic regression" refers to the notion of the logistic function that it employs. The logistic function, often known as the sigmoid function, is a mathematical function. This logistic function has a value between zero and one. Some assumptions made before utilizing Logistic Regressions are: 
#### 1. The target variables in binary logistic regression must always be binary, and the intended outcome is represented by the factor level 1. 
#### 2. The model should not have any multi-collinearity, which indicates that the independent variables must be independent of one another. 
#### 3. In order for our model to be useful, we must include meaningful variables. 
#### 4. For logistic regression, we need use a big sample size.
