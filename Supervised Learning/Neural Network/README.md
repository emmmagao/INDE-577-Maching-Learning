# Neural Network
Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning that provide the foundation of deep learning techniques. Their name and form are inspired by the human brain, and they replicate the way real neurons communicate with one another. Training data is used by neural networks to learn and increase their accuracy over time. However, once these learning algorithms have been fine-tuned for accuracy, they become formidable tools in computer science field, allowing scientists to categorize and cluster data at rapid speeds. When compared to manual identification by human specialists, tasks in speech recognition or picture recognition can be completed in minutes rather than hours. Google's search algorithm is one of the most well-known neural networks.
