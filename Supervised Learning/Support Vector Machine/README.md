# SVM
In machine learning, Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. In Support Vector Regression, the straight line that is required to fit the data is referred to as hyperplane. The objective of a support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points. The data points on either side of the hyperplane that are closest to the hyperplane are called Support Vectors. These influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane and thus help build the SVM.

## Dataset
In this project, I will use Gender Classification Dataset from Kaggle
 - longhair: This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "long hair" and 0 is "not long hair".
 - foreheadwidthcm: This column is in CM's. This is the width of the forehead. 
 - foreheadheightcm: This is the height of the forehead and it's in Cm's.
 - nosewide: This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "wide nose" and 0 is "not wide nose". 
 - noselong: This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 is "Long nose" and 0 is "not long nose".
 - lipsthin: This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "thin lips" while 0 is "Not thin lips".
 - distancenosetoliplong: This column contains 0's and 1's where 1 represents the "long distance between nose and lips" while 0 is "short distance between nose and lips".
 - gender: This is either "Male" or "Female".

## Task
In this project, I will use SVM to find the classification on gender.
