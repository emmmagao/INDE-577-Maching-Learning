# Decision Tree
A decision tree is a kind of supervised machine learning that categorizes or predicts outcomes based on the answers to a previous set of questions. The model is supervised learning, which means it is trained and tested on a set of data containing the intended categorisation. It's possible that the decision tree won't always produce a clear answer or decision. It might give possibilities so that the data scientist can make their own informed conclusion. A decision tree is shaped like a tree. The root node is the tree's foundation. A series of decision nodes flow from the root node, depicting decisions to be made. Leaf nodes emerge from the decision nodes, representing the decisions' implications. Each decision node represents a query or split point, and the leaf nodes that sprout from it represent possible replies. Leaf nodes emerge from decision nodes in the same way that a leaf emerges from a tree branch. This is why each part of a decision tree is referred to as a "branch."
