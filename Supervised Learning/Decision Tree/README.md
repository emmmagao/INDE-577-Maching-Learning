# Decision Tree
A decision tree is a kind of supervised machine learning that categorizes or predicts outcomes based on the answers to a previous set of questions. The model is supervised learning, which means it is trained and tested on a set of data containing the intended categorisation. It's possible that the decision tree won't always produce a clear answer or decision. It might give possibilities so that the data scientist can make their own informed conclusion. A decision tree is shaped like a tree. The root node is the tree's foundation. A series of decision nodes flow from the root node, depicting decisions to be made. Leaf nodes emerge from the decision nodes, representing the decisions' implications. Each decision node represents a query or split point, and the leaf nodes that sprout from it represent possible replies. Leaf nodes emerge from decision nodes in the same way that a leaf emerges from a tree branch. This is why each part of a decision tree is referred to as a "branch."

## Dataset
In this project, I will use Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle, There are 10 variables:
 - Heartdiease: Respondents that have ever reported having coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI)
 - #BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI)
 - Smoking: Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life? [Note: 5 packs = 100 cigarettes]
 - Alcohol Drinking: Heavy drinkers (adult men having more than 14 drinks per week and adult women having more than 7 drinks per week
 - Stroke: (Ever told) (you had) a stroke?
 - Physical Health: Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days?
 - Mental health: Thinking about your mental health, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? 
 - Diffwalking: Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?
 - Sex
 - Age

## Task
In this project, I will find the optimal depth and plot the tree
