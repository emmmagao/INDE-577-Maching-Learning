# Perceptron
A Perceptron is a supervised learning technique for binary classifiers. This approach enables neurons to learn and interpret training set components one at a time. Perceptrons are classified into two types: Multilayer and single layer. A single layer Only linearly separable patterns can be learned by single layer perceptrons. Multilayer: The processing capability of multilayer perceptrons or feedforward neural networks with two or more layers is larger. In order to build a linear decision boundary, the Perceptron algorithm learns the weights for the input signals. This allows you to tell the difference between the two linearly separable classes, +1 and -1.
