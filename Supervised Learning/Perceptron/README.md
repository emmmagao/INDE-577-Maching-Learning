# Perceptron
A Perceptron is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers. Binary classifiers decide whether an input, usually represented by a series of vectors, belongs to a specific class. In short, a perceptron is a single-layer neural network. They consist of four main parts including input values, weights and bias, net sum, and an activation function. 

The process begins by taking all the input values and multiplying them by their weights. Then, all of these multiplied values are added together to create the weighted sum. The weighted sum is then applied to the activation function, producing the perceptron's output. The activation function plays the integral role of ensuring the output is mapped between required values such as (0,1) or (-1,1). It is important to note that the weight of an input is indicative of the strength of a node. Similarly, an input's bias value gives the ability to shift the activation function curve up or down.

As a simplified form of a neural network, specifically a single-layer neural network, perceptrons play an important role in binary classification. This means the perceptron is used to classify data into two parts, hence binary. Sometimes, perceptrons are also referred to as linear binary classifiers for this reason.

## Data
In this project, I will use Classification in asteroseismology datasetã€‚
- Pop: [0/1] Population (1)
Population as follows:
0 = RGB
1 = HeB

RGB (Red Giant Branch)

HeB (Helium Burning)
- Dnu F8.5 (uHz) Mean large frequency separation of modes with the same degree and consecutive order, {DELTA}nu
- numax F9.5 (uHz) Frequency of maximum oscillation power
- epsilon F7.3 Location of the l=0 mode (2)

## Task
In this project, I will write perceptron from scratch.
