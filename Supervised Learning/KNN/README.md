## K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
#### Definition
The K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm is one of the Supervised Learning algorithms. KNN assumes that the new data and existing data are similar and places the new data in the category that is most similar to the existing categories. KNN algorithm saves all available data and classifies a new data point based on its similarity to the existing data. This means that new data can be quickly sorted into a well-defined category.
KNN algorithm can be used for both regression and classification, but it is more commonly employed for classification problems, and it's a non-parametric algorithm which means it makes no assumptions about the data it's working with. During the training phase, the KNN algorithm simply stores the dataset, and when it receives new data, it classifies it into a category that is quite similar to the new data.
