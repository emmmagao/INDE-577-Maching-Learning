# K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
## Definition
The K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm is one of the Supervised Learning algorithms. KNN assumes that the new data and existing data are similar and places the new data in the category that is most similar to the existing categories. KNN algorithm saves all available data and classifies a new data point based on its similarity to the existing data. This means that new data can be quickly sorted into a well-defined category. KNN algorithm can be used for both regression and classification, but it is more commonly employed for classification problems, and it's a non-parametric algorithm which means it makes no assumptions about the data it's working with. During the training phase, the KNN algorithm simply stores the dataset, and when it receives new data, it classifies it into a category that is quite similar to the new data.
## Dataset
In this project, I will use Diabetes Dataset dataset from kaggle. 
 - Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
 - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
 - BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
 - SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
 - Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
 - BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
 - DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
 - Age: Age (years)
 - Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Task
For this project, I will predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.
