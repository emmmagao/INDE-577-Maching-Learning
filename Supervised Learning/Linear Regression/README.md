# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised Machine Learning model that identifies the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variables, i.e. the linear connection between the dependent and independent variables. There are two forms of linear regression: simple and multiple. Simple Linear Regression is used when there is only one independent variable and the model must determine the linear connection between it and the dependent variable. In contrast, Multiple Linear Regression uses more than one independent variable to find the link. The basic goal of a Linear Regression model is to determine the best fit linear line and the ideal intercept and coefficient values such that the error is minimized.
