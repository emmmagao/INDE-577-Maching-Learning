# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised Machine Learning model that identifies the best fit linear line between the independent and dependent variables, i.e. the linear connection between the dependent and independent variables. There are two forms of linear regression: simple and multiple. Simple Linear Regression is used when there is only one independent variable and the model must determine the linear connection between it and the dependent variable. In contrast, Multiple Linear Regression uses more than one independent variable to find the link. The basic goal of a Linear Regression model is to determine the best fit linear line and the ideal intercept and coefficient values such that the error is minimized.
## Dataset
I will use the medical cost personal dataset from Kaggle. This dataset includes 7 data types: 
**** age: age of primary beneficiary
**** sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
**** bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
****objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
****children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
****smoker: Smoking
****region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
****charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
## Task
In this project,I will build a linear refression model from scratch. The goal is to find the relationships between different variables and insurance cost.
